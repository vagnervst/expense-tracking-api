# Finance API :octocat:

Expense tracking Node API intended for backend practicing. My main objective with this repo is to experiment with different technologies and practices so I can get a better understading of the most used solutions to common problems, and why they are used in the first place.

Here I list some of them but this is not a full specification of what is used on the project:
- JWT
- Domain Driven Design
- Test Driven Development
- Backend integration on Jest
- Dependency Injection to provide better interfaces for unit testing

## Running

**Requirements**
 - docker
 - docker-compose

All available commands are defined on the [Makefile](./Makefile), like: `make start`, `make stop` and `make test-integration`
